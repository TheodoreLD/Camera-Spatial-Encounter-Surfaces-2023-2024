# Data Inputs

Raw camera-trap data are not committed to this repository. To rerun the final
models, place the required CSV files in this `data/` folder, or set
`WOLF_DATA_DIR` to the folder that contains them.

The raw camera-trap survey data are private and will be released with the
associated publication. No sample data are distributed here; this repository
provides the analysis code and curated result outputs only.

## Which File Feeds Which Surface

Eight distinct CSV files produce all seven surfaces. Several are shared: the
human-activity companions re-read the same road-camera files as their wolf
counterparts, and the two March 2024 companions share one deployment file.

| Runner | Results folder | Required input files |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `run_road_2023.R` | `results/road_2023/` | `deployments_2023.csv`, `observations_2023.csv` |
| `run_road_2024.R` | `results/road_2024/` | `deployments_2024.csv`, `observations_2024.csv` |
| `run_forest_2024.R` | `results/forest_2024/` | `forest_camera_trap_events.csv` |
| `run_road_2023_human.R` | `results/human_2023/` | `deployments_2023.csv`, `observations_2023.csv` |
| `run_road_2024_human.R` | `results/human_2024/` | `deployments_2024.csv`, `observations_2024.csv` |
| `run_road_march2024_wolf.R` | `results/wolf_march_2024/` | `deployments_march2024.csv`, `observations_march2024.csv` |
| `run_road_march2024_human.R` | `results/human_march_2024/` | `deployments_march2024.csv`, `observations_humanmarch2024.csv` |

Place all eight in this `data/` folder and every runner resolves its own inputs
with no further configuration. If they live elsewhere, point `WOLF_DATA_DIR` at
the folder holding them; the forest flat file can be overridden separately with
`WOLF_FOREST_FILE`, and `run_forest_2024.R` also accepts the alternate name
`Forest_2024_camera_trap_events.csv`.

## Reproducing The Published Results

Every file under `results/` was generated with the publication profile:

```bash
WOLF_RUN_PROFILE=final Rscript scripts/run_road_2023.R
```

`WOLF_RUN_PROFILE` controls simulation effort — `quick` (no spatial CV),
`balanced` (the default), or `final`. The committed outputs all record
`run_profile,final` in their `_run_manifest.csv`, so anything else will not
reproduce them.

Two classes of difference are expected even from an exact rerun, and neither
changes any reported conclusion:

- INLA's optimizer converges to slightly different points between runs,
  shifting hyperparameters and WAIC in the 5th to 7th significant figure.
- The simulation-based diagnostics (posterior predictive checks, Moran
  permutation tests, PIT, spatial block cross-validation) depend on the RNG
  stream, so they move in the 2nd to 3rd decimal even under the fixed seed.

The mapped GeoTIFF surfaces are stable to within roughly 1e-03 relative
difference, and the diagnostic gate outcomes and model selection are
reproducible exactly. See `results/session_info.txt` for the R and INLA
versions used.

## Required Files

For the forest-camera 2024 model:

```text
forest_camera_trap_events.csv
```

A custom path or filename can be supplied with `WOLF_FOREST_FILE`.

For the road-camera 2024 model:

```text
deployments_2024.csv
observations_2024.csv
```

For the road-camera 2023 model:

```text
deployments_2023.csv
observations_2023.csv
```

For the March 2024 single-month spatial-only companions (wolf and human-activity):

```text
deployments_march2024.csv           # shared road-camera deployments (clipped to March)
observations_march2024.csv          # wolf events
observations_humanmarch2024.csv     # human/vehicle events (Homo sapiens, cars, bikes, motorcycle)
```

These are the March 2024 slice of the full multi-year camera-trap dataset:
deployments clipped to the March 2024 window, the distinct wolf events, and the
distinct human/vehicle events with an `eventStart` in March 2024. They share the
same road-camera deployment file and use the observation schema below.

## Required Fields

The forest-camera flat file must contain:

```text
deploymentID
eventID
eventStart
scientificName
plotID
deploymentEffort
latitude
longitude
startDate
endDate
```

The road-camera deployment file must contain:

```text
deploymentID
locationID
latitude
longitude
deploymentStart
deploymentEnd
```

The road-camera observation file must contain:

```text
deploymentID
eventID
scientificName
eventStart
```

## Event Definition

The scripts count distinct wolf `eventID` values where `scientificName` is
`Canis_lupus` or `Canis lupus`. The analysis assumes each event ID represents an
independent wolf event according to the camera-trap processing workflow.

The human-activity companion runners (`run_road_2023_human.R`,
`run_road_2024_human.R`) instead count events labelled `Homo sapiens`, `cars`,
`bikes`, or `motorcycle` from the same road-camera observation files, as a
relative human-disturbance index.

## How Camera Effort And Events Are Assigned To Months

All final models use camera-month rows. If a camera deployment spans more than
one month, the active camera-days are divided among the months in which the
camera was active. Wolf events are then counted in the month indicated by their
`eventStart` timestamp.

This is required because the multi-month models include month effects: the wolf
count for a month must be paired with the camera effort from that same month.
(The two single-month March 2024 surfaces fit no month effect, but the same
per-month effort accounting is used to isolate the March exposure and events.)

This keeps the count data and the exposure data aligned before fitting month
effects.
